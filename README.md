# DiveConditions
This project is a draft for reporting and analysing diving conditions like visibility and so on. The project fullfills the following purposes:

 1. Build something divers can use.
 1. Practice with ASP.Net 5.
 1. Build my first CQRS/ES applicaiton.
 1. Build something I can deploy later on at Azure and get experiences there.

Hopefully this page can one day be changed in something that represents an online web application.
